# Coordinate systems {#cs}

For spatial data, the location of observations are characterised by
coordinates, and coordinates are defined in a coordinate system.
Different coordinate systems can be used for this, and the most
important difference is whether coordinates are defined over a
2-dimensional or 3-dimensional space referenced to orthogonal axes
(Cartesian coordinates), or using distance and directions (polar
coordinates, spherical coordinates).

```{r polar, out.width = '50%', fig.cap="Two-dimensional polar (red) and Cartesian (blue) coordinates", eval=TRUE, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
par(mar = rep(0,4))
plot(3, 4, xlim = c(-6,6), ylim = c(-6,6), asp = 1)
axis(1, pos = 0, at = 0:6)
axis(2, pos = 0, at = -6:6)
xd = seq(-5, 5, by = .1)
lines(xd, sqrt(25 - xd^2), col = 'grey')
lines(xd, -sqrt(25 - xd^2), col = 'grey')
arrows(0, 0, 3, 4, col = 'red', length = .15, angle = 20)
text(1.5, 2.7, label = "r", col = 'red')
xd = seq(3/5, 1, by = .1)
lines(xd, sqrt(1 - xd^2), col = 'red')
text(1.2, 0.5, label = parse(text = "phi"), col = 'red')
lines(c(3,3), c(0,4), lty = 2, col = 'blue')
lines(c(0,3), c(4,4), lty = 2, col = 'blue')

```

## Cartesian and geodetic coordinates
Figure \@ref(fig:polar) shows both polar and Cartesian coordinates
for a standard two-dimensional situation. In Cartesian coordinates,
the point shown is $(x,y) = (3,4)$, for polar coordinates it is
$(r,\phi) = (5, \mbox{arctan}(4/3))$, where $\mbox{arctan}(4/3)$ is
approximately $0.93$ radians, or $53^{\circ}$. Note that $x$, $y$
and $r$ all have length units, where $\phi$ is an angle (a unitless
length/length ratio). Converting back and forth between Cartesian
and polar coordinates is trivial, 
$$x = r~\mbox{cos} \phi$$
$$y = r~\mbox{sin} \phi$$
$$\phi = \mbox{arctan}(y/x)$$
$$r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$
but requires care with using the right quadrant for $\mbox{arctan}$;
the `atan2` function is helpful here.

## Ellipsoidal coordinates

In three dimensions, where Cartesian coordinates are expressed as
$(x,y,z)$, spherical coordinates are the three-dimensional equivalent
of polar coordinates and can be expressed as $(r,\lambda,\phi)$, where

* $r$ is the radius of the sphere,
* $\lambda$ is the longitude, measured in the $(x,y)$ plane counter-clockwise from positive $x$, and
* $\phi$ is the latitude, the angle between the vector and the $(x,y)$ plane.

$\lambda$ typically varies between $-180^{\circ}$ and $180^{\circ}$
(or alternatively from $0^{\circ}$ to $360^{\circ}$), $\phi$ from
$-90^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$.  When we are only interested in points
_on_ a sphere with given radius, we can drop $r$: $(\lambda,\phi)$
now suffice to identify any point.

It should be noted that this is just _a_ definition, one could for
instance also choose to measure polar angle, i.e. the angle between
the vector and $z$, instead of latitude. There is also a long
tradition of specifying points as $(\phi,\lambda)$ but throughout
this book we will stick to longitude-latitude, $(\lambda,\phi)$.

For points on an ellipse, there are two ways in which angle can be
expressed (figure \@ref(fig:ellipse)): measured from the center of
the ellipse ($\psi$), or measured perpendicular to the tangent on
the ellipse at the target point ($\phi$).

```{r ellipse, out.width = '50%', fig.cap="Angles on an ellipse: geodetic (blue) and geocentric (red) latitude", eval=TRUE, fig=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
par(mar = rep(0,4))
x = 4
y = 5/8 * sqrt(48)
plot(x, y, xlim = c(-6,6), ylim = c(-8,8), asp = 1)
axis(1, pos = 0, at = 0:9)
axis(2, pos = 0, at = -5:5)
xd = seq(-8, 8, by = .1)
lines(xd, 5/8 * sqrt(64 - xd^2), col = 'grey')
lines(xd, 5/8 * -sqrt(64 - xd^2), col = 'grey')
arrows(0, 0, x, y, col = 'red', length = .15, angle = 20)
b = (x * 25) / (-y * 64)
a = y - x * b
abline(a, b, col = 'grey')
b = -1/b
x0 = x - y / b
arrows(x0, 0, x, y, col = 'blue', length = .15, angle = 20)
text(1.2, 0.5, label = parse(text = "psi"), col = 'red')
text(3, 0.5, label = parse(text = "phi"), col = 'blue')
```

The most commonly used parametric model for the Earth is _an
ellipsoid of revolution_, an ellipsoid with two equal semi-axes
[@iliffelott]. In effect, this is a flattened sphere (or spheroid):
the distance between the poles is (slightly: about 0.33%) smaller
than the distance between two opposite points on the equator. Under
this model, longitude is always measured along a circle, but latitude
along an ellipse. If we think of figure \@ref(fig:ellipse) as a
cross section of the Earth passing through the poles, the latitude
measure $\phi$ is the one used when no further specification is
given; it is also called _geodetic latitude_. The latitude measure
$\psi$ is called the _geocentric latitude_.

In addition to longitude and latitude we can add _altitude_ to define
points that are not on the spheroid, and obtain a three dimensional
space again. When defining altitude, we need to choose 

* where zero altitude is: on the ellipsoid, or relative to the surface approximating mean sea level (the geoid)?
* which direction is positive, and 
* which direction is "straight up": perpendicular to the spheroid surface,
or in the direction perpendicular to the surface of the geoid?

All these choices may matter, depending on the application area.

## Distances

Distances between two points $p_i$ and $p_j$ in Cartesian coordinates are computed
as Euclidian distances, in two dimensions by
$$d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2}$$
with $p_i = (x_i,y_i)$
and in three dimensions by
$$d_{ij} = \sqrt{(x_i-x_j)^2+(y_i-y_j)^2+(z_i-z_j)^2}$$
with $p_i = (x_i,y_i,z_i).$
These distances represent the length of a _straight_ line between
two points $i$ and $j$.

For two points on a circle, the length of the arc of two points $c_1 = (r,{\phi}_i)$ and
$c_2 = (r, \phi_2)$ is
$$s_{ij}=r~|\phi_1-\phi_2| = r ~\theta$$
with $\theta$ the angle between $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ in radians.
For very small values of $\theta$, we will have $s_{ij} \approx d_{ij}$.

For two points $p_1 = (\lambda_1,\phi_1)$ and $p_2 =
(\lambda_2,\phi_2)$ on a sphere with radius $r'$, the _great circle
distance_ is the arc length between $p_1$ and $p_2$ on the circle
that passes through $p_1$ and $p_2$ and has the center of the sphere as its center, and
is given by $s_{12} = r ~ \theta_{12}$ with
$$\theta_{12} = \arccos(\sin \phi_1 \cdot \sin \phi_2 + \cos \phi_1 \cdot \cos \phi_2 \cdot \cos(|\lambda_1-\lambda_2|))$$
the angle between $p_1$ and $p_2$, in radians.

Arc distances between two points on a spheroid are more complicated
to compute.  Details about the computation method used in package
`lwgeom` (which, in turn, is used by package `sf`) are given in
@karney2013algorithms.

## Bounded spaces

All the above assumes pure geometric computations in spaces where
there are no unexpected obstructions. When we move through space
on a daily basis, we typically find constraints e.g.

* when we walk through a building
* when we cycle to work
* or when we drive to a shop.

Distances, in such case, can be made up of a sequence of shortest
(straight line or great circle) distances, but follow a more
complex path than a straight line. Typical constraints come from
road networks, or from the requirement for a certain habitat for
movement (water for fish, forest for certain bird species).

## Time

When we describe over which "space" a certain phenomenon is
characterised, time forms an integral component: nothing exists
forever. It is tempting to think that compared to geographical
"space", time is one-dimensional "linear", and that is often the way we address
time, e.g. in R where `Date` is represented by the number of days
since 1970-01-01
```{r}
(d = as.Date("1970-02-01"))
as.numeric(d)
```
and `POSIXt` time by the number of seconds since the start of that date
```{r}
(t = as.POSIXct("1970-01-02 00:00", tz = "UTC"))
as.numeric(t)
```
In practical cases however, we may be interested in how certain
phenomena vary over the day, or over the year, in which case it may
be more convenient to represent time as the tuple (year, day-of-year),
or (day, time-of-day). When we study for instance traffic patterns,
day of week plays a role, in which we may end up with (year,
week-of-year, day-of-week, time-of-day) in order to quantify hourly,
daily, weekly, and yearly signals. This decomposes time essentially in two
or more components, with some of them having a cyclic character.

## Exercises

* convert the $(x,y)$ points $(10,2)$, $(-10,-2)$, $(10,-2)$ and $(0,10)$ to polar coordinates
* convert the polar $(r,\phi)$ points $(10,45^{\circ})$, $(0,100^{\circ})$ and $(5,359^{\circ})$ to Cartesian coordinates
* assuming the Earth is a sphere with a radius of 6371 km, compute for $(\lambda,\phi)$ points the great circle distance between $(10,10)$ and $(11,10)$, between $(10,80)$ and $(11,80)$, between $(10,10)$ and $(10,11)$ and between $(10,80)$ and $(10,81)$ (units: degree). What are the distance units?
